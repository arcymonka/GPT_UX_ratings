14,Moderate to high mental effort to monitor hazards and the car's responses.,2,"I felt somewhat anxious due to the sudden hazard, but stayed composed.",1,"Slight agitation from the abrupt braking, yet I remained calm.",-2,There was a real risk of collision when the van cut into our lane.,1,"I felt cautiously confident in the car's handling, though still careful.",4,"I trust the automated system to manage hazards, given it performed braking.",4,I can rely on the system to avoid conflicts in traffic.,3,"The system state was fairly clear, even with the jolt and camera tilt.",2,The system's response felt predictable and not surprising.,4,I could understand why the brake was applied and the van's move.,3,It's hard to tell what the system will do next in a lane with a van turning.,6,The automation was very useful in avoiding a collision.,5,The experience was unpleasant due to the hazard and abrupt stops.,3,"The experience was not ideal, but the outcome was acceptable.",4,"The event was annoying due to the shake and stress, though tolerable.",6,The system was effective in slowing and avoiding collision.,5,"Despite the stress, I found the system somewhat likeable for keeping us safe.",6,The automated braking clearly assisted us and was worthwhile.,6,"The incident itself is undesirable, but the automation proved desirable for safety.",6,It raised my alertness rather than sleep-inducing.,5,The situation was changeable and required quick adaptation.,6,The scenario was quite complicated with multiple moving parts.,6,"Several variables were changing at once, increasing complexity.",5,I felt moderate arousal from the hazard.,6,I concentrated on the road and vehicle actions throughout.,3,"My attention was mainly focused, with only minor divisions between cues.",4,I had some mental capacity to spare for other thoughts.,5,I gained information about system behavior in a hazardous moment.,5,The information I gained was good and relevant for assessing safety.,3,I am not very familiar with how this system handles such scenarios.
