14,Hazards required continuous attention and quick interpretation due to cyclist and bend.,2,The sudden near-miss and braking raised mild anxiety.,1,Somewhat calm despite the abrupt event.,2,The left-lane incursion created an unsafe moment requiring urgent braking.,1,I felt somewhat confident in the vehicle's ability to handle the situation.,4,I trust the automation to handle hazards.,4,I can rely on the automated system to brake and respond.,3,The system state was not always obviously clear during the rapid events.,2,The system's behavior did not seem unpredictable; it followed expected safety responses.,4,I could understand why braking and actions occurred.,3,It's difficult to predict exactly what the system will do next.,6,The experience was useful for evaluating the system's safety.,3,The drive was unpleasant due to tension.,3,Overall impression was that the drive was not ideal due to risk.,3,The experience was annoying despite proper functioning.,6,The action was effective in avoiding a collision.,4,The sudden braking and jolting was irritating.,6,The system's assistance helped avoid collision.,6,Desirable safety outcome from automated intervention.,6,Alertness raised by the rapid sequence.,6,Situation changed quickly with multiple moving parts.,5,Situation is quite complicated with several factors.,6,Many variables were changing simultaneously.,5,Arousal level increased due to hazard.,6,I was concentrating heavily on the road and system actions.,3,Attention was mostly on driving; not heavily divided.,3,Some mental capacity remained for monitoring.,4,I gained useful information about how the system responds.,5,The information gained was good for understanding the system.,3,I am somewhat unfamiliar with this intersection and scenario.
