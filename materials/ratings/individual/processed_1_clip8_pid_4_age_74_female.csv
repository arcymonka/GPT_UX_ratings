15,The rapid sequence of events required sustained attention.,2,I felt a surge of worry during the sudden cut-in and hard brake.,2,The sudden jerk and the potential crash increased agitation.,-3,A van cut into our lane creating an imminent collision risk.,1,I maintained some confidence in the automated braking.,4,I generally trust the system to handle sudden hazards.,4,The system demonstrated capable braking in the moment.,3,The camera jolted and the view became less clear.,2,"Unpredictable behavior came from other drivers, not the system.",4,Cause-and-effect was understandable after the braking event.,4,Predicting the system's next move was difficult.,6,The automated braking prevented a collision.,3,The ride was tense and not very pleasant.,5,The intervention was effective and we avoided a crash.,3,The jolts were somewhat annoying.,6,The brake response was effective in preventing harm.,4,The abrupt stop was startling but not overly irritating.,6,The automation assisted by avoiding a crash.,6,The automation's intervention was desirable for safety.,6,The incident increased my alertness rather than fatigue.,6,Multiple changing elements created variability.,6,Traffic dynamics and occlusions made the situation quite complex.,6,Many variables were changing rapidly in the scene.,5,There was heightened physiological arousal during the event.,6,I focused attention on the road and potential hazards.,3,"Attention was mostly on the road, not heavily divided.",2,Cognitive resources were partially depleted by the load.,5,I gained new cues about vehicle behavior and surroundings.,5,The information gathered was of good quality.,3,The exact scenario was unfamiliar.
