15,"Complex, multi-threat scene requiring sustained attention.",-2,Near-miss events and unpredictable drivers increased anxiety.,2,Jolting camera shake and sudden braking increased agitation.,-3,Close obstacle risk and near-collision created strong sense of danger.,1,Still confident in car's ability to handle hazards.,4,I trust the autopilot to brake in emergencies.,4,I can rely on its response to traffic surprises.,4,The vehicle's behavior and cues were reasonably clear.,3,There were a few abrupt maneuvers by the system that felt somewhat unpredictable.,4,The sequence of events was explainable: other vehicles caused it.,3,Next action was not obvious due to dynamic traffic.,6,Automation provided critical safety assistance; very useful.,2,The ride was stressful and unpleasant overall.,2,The experience felt bad due to risk and stress.,6,The experience was more annoying due to near-miss stress.,2,Automation was effective in preventing a crash.,3,Some automation-induced alerts were irritating but tolerable.,2,The system assisted in braking and steering.,6,The automation is desirable for safety in such scenarios.,6,"The situation kept me highly alert, not sleepy.",6,Several unpredictable vehicle movements changed the scene quickly.,6,Multiple agents and actions with near-miss create high complexity.,6,"Pedestrians, vehicles, positions, and speeds all changing.",6,I felt a high arousal level from the frantic events.,6,Concentrating hard to monitor the dynamic traffic.,4,Attention was divided between multiple moving hazards and road features.,3,Cognitive load consumed most spare capacity.,5,Gained important situational information about others' actions.,5,The information is fairly reliable and helpful for assessing risk.,3,Not fully familiar with this specific environment; had seen similar patterns but not this exact setup.
